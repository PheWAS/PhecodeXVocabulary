# PhecodeXVocabulary
This repo includes support files for phecodes, of which there are two main types:
- Mapping files which specify the ICD codes that define a phecode
- Information files which include descriptions of phecodes (e.g. phecode strings and phecode categories)

The files can be found in subfolders, labeled by the version of phecodes. **Phecode_V1.2** contains support files for version 1.2 (V1.2) -- the original phecodes first published in 2013. **PhecodeX** contains support files for phecodeX, an expanded version of phecodes released in 2023.
